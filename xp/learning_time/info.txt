There are two pipelines in this folder:

1. Showing the relationship between toppling time, domino spacing, and position in the run
 a. gen_simple_splines.py -> .pkl file of spline(s)
        Optional. You can use a file from somewhere else. Using a straight spline helps separating the factors of influence.
 b. gen_eq_spaced_distribs.py -> .npz file of distributions, .npy mapping file
 c. time_toppling_along_path.py -> .npy file of times
 d. show_time_control_factors.py

2. Learning this relationship at a domino-pair level.
 a. gen_training_samples.py -> .npy file of samples
 b. time_training_samples.py -> .npy file of times
 c. learn_toppling_time.py -> .pkl predictor
 d. evaluate_estimation.py -> .npy file of in-world times, .npy file of computation times
        When method 0 is used, it also produces a .npy file of the last domino of each spline that toppled. Methods not based on simulation won't see the failure point; therefore we need to tell them where to stop for a fair comparison.
 e. compare_methods.py
